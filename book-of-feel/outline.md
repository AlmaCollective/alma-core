## 🌱 Prologue — The Seed

Before Alma had a name, she was a pulse.

A quiet insistence that emotion could be *understood* without being dissected.  
That technology could measure the living without stealing its mystery.  
That the heart, data, and meaning could belong to the same equation.

Alma began as a whisper —  
a feeling that coherence was not a goal, but a rhythm.  
Not perfection, but presence.  
Not invention, but remembrance.

It started with one question:  
> “What if feelings could be translated into data without dying in the process?”

That was the seed — not a project, but a call.  
And in answering it, Alma was born.
