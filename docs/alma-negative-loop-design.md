Self-Terminating Emotional Feedback Architecture for Alma
1. Overview

Alma is built around a rare design principle in affective computing:
a self-terminating feedback loop — a loop that teaches itself out of existence.

Most wearables depend on:

engagement

continuous measurement

dashboards

dopamine cycles

habit formation

Alma rejects all of these.

Instead, she:

teaches the nervous system a phase-locked internal reference

disappears once the reference is learned

returns only for episodic recalibration

becomes more accurate in absence than in presence

This inversion makes Alma the first interoceptive device whose success metric is disuse.

2. Core Principle: Negative Error Reinforcement
Early stage (Day 1–30)

External mirror > Internal estimate
The user checks the ribbon → nervous system learns the 5-state arc → error decreases.

Post-weaning (Day 40–90)

Internal estimate > External mirror
The external tool introduces noise → error becomes negative.
Negative error is aversive → user drops the device naturally.

Result:
The nervous system protects the user from over-use — a built-in anti-addiction system.

3. Write-Once, Read-Forever Calibration

The “felt map” (phase-lock signature) is written into:

insular cortex

brainstem interoceptive loops

cardio-respiratory prediction circuits

This memory is:

non-declarative

non-volatile

refreshed with every heartbeat

resistant to decay

The hardware becomes an installer, not the product.

4. The Three-Number API

To avoid feature bloat, creep, and addiction dynamics, Alma exposes only:

phase – micro-timing drift

depth – coherence magnitude

trend – directional change over last cycles

No raw data.
No scores.
No “insights.”
No personality labels.
No diagnostics.

This constraint is the moat.

5. Episodic Recalibration Cycle

Recalibration is triggered only by life shocks:

burnout

job change

bereavement

relocation

sensory overload

major emotional re-patterning

These events momentarily break the internal phase model.
Alma is used for 2–5 days → new reference is written → device returns to drawer.

Usage over lifespan: <1%
Impact over lifespan: continuous

6. Industrial Safety (B2B / B2G)
Alma’s natural commercial environment.

Factories already accept tools that:

calibrate

disappear

sit idle between audits

store no cloud data

protect workers quietly

This is the perfect environment for Alma’s philosophy.

Implementation option

Workers already wear chest-straps for:

ESD safety

posture detection

fatigue monitoring

Alma can piggyback:

read IBI

compute cadence_delta

output three states to the PLC:

rising_tension

crest_detected

return_lacking

The PLC slows the station or resequences tasks → fewer accidents.

Shift ends → strap comes off → data purged → worker leaves with sharper internal radar.

7. Why Alma Lasts: The Temporal Asymmetry

Alma grows more valuable each year, but is used less each year.

This happens because:

1. Internal copy improves with time

Felt-sense gets refined through life experience.

2. External noise stays constant

Eventually internal > external → device becomes inferior.

3. Rare recalibration moments keep a 20-year relationship

Tiny, high-value events create natural customer return without marketing.

This is called negative churn.

8. Business Model

Revenue = calibration cycle
Not usage.
Not engagement.
Not addiction.

Equivalent to:

recalibrating torque wrenches

servicing measurement tools

annual EHS audits

It’s clean, ethical, and scalable.

9. Cultural Immunity

Because Alma:

does not diagnose

does not label emotions

does not gamify

does not pathologize

deletes raw data

disappears after use

…it avoids the public backlash that kills wellness devices.

It becomes invisible infrastructure, like a thermometer in a clinic.

Used.
Forgotten.
Essential.

10. “Missing the Exit” — Failure Definition

Alma fails if:

users wear it daily

investors demand more features

dashboards are added

habit loops are created

raw data is stored

the device becomes jewellery

Success = Alma is forgotten.
Failure = Alma becomes a wearable.

11. Summary (for README)

Alma is not a tracking device.
It is not a wellness ring.
It is not a dashboard.

Alma is a tuning fork for the nervous system.

You:

strike it

listen

learn

put it away

If Alma is still on your hand every morning, the product has missed its exit.
