# Alma Core Documentation

This folder contains conceptual and technical documentation for Alma's emotional architecture.

## Current documents

- `../alma-complex-dynamics.md`  
  Defines how Alma interprets emotional volatility and complex weight over time.

## Planned documents

- `emotion-layer-model.md` — layered representation of emotions (body, feeling, emotion, meaning, coherence)
- `coherence-spiral.md` — how Alma computes coherence and learns in rhythmic cycles
- `api-map.md` — overview of backend endpoints for emotional data

From here, contributors can navigate the core ideas behind Alma and see how biosignals are transformed into meaning.
