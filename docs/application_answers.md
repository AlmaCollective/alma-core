1. What problem are you solving?

People lack gentle, non-intrusive ways to notice and regulate shifts in their internal state without being overwhelmed by data or prescriptive tools.

2. Why now?

Advances in sensing and AI have outpaced our ability to design humane interpretation layers. Alma addresses this gap by prioritizing cadence and restraint.

3. Why are you the right person?

Alma emerges from a long-term, hands-on exploration of emotional sensing, system boundaries, and human-centered design, grounded in both technical work and lived experience.

4. What makes Alma different?

Alma avoids diagnosis, optimization, and prediction, focusing instead on presence, rhythm, and interpretive cues.

5. What is your current stage?

Conceptually complete core system with defined scope, boundaries, and functional flow; preparing for selective feedback and early collaboration.
