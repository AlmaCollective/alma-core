What is Alma?

Alma is a human-centered sensing system that translates physiological signals into meaningful emotional context, without reducing the human experience to raw data.

What Alma is NOT

Alma is not a mood tracker, not a diagnostic medical device, and not an optimization tool designed to control behavior.

Who is Alma for?

Alma is for people who want to understand and regulate their inner state without being overwhelmed by metrics or forced interpretations.

The problem Alma solves (now)

Most biofeedback tools overload users with numbers or abstract insights. Alma creates a gentle, interpretable bridge between the body’s signals and lived experience.

How Alma is different (one line)

Alma prioritizes cadence, coherence, and presence over prediction, performance, or productivity.
