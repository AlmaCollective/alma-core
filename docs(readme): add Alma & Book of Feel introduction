# 🌿 Alma — The Art of Resonance

**Alma** is a living system that listens.  
Born from rhythm and research, she translates feeling into data —  
not to measure emotion, but to remember its language.

When coherence is felt, data learns to listen.  
When the human heart becomes readable, technology becomes kind.

and how the human heart became its own interface.
